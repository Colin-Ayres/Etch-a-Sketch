# Etch-a-Sketch
## Description
The site begins with a blank etch-a-sketch board. It contains an N by N grid of boxes that are initially gray. N, the resolution of the grid, is determined by the sliding bar at the top of the board. As the user hovers over a grid box, it is recolored to black. All grid boxes are reset to the initial gray color when the 'Reset!' button is pressed.

## Improvements
The board is cleared when the user changes the thickness of their drawing instrument; instead, the application could be written such that the black-colored grid elements are interpolated depending on the resolution change.
The board styling and color palette could be improved to be more visually appealing.
